<button class="collapsible">What is Sitio Bebe?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Sitio Bebe is a community that suffers from various health issues that affect their respiratory systems, such as acute respiratory infection, hypertension, and acute lower respiratory tract infection. These diseases are caused by poor living conditions, lack of hygiene, and exposure to pollutants. The community also faces challenges such as poverty, water shortage, lack of medicine, and proper medical care. They have limited access to basic needs, education, and opportunities. The local government and some schools try to help them by providing clean water and outreach programs, but they are not enough to address all their problems. Sitio Bebe needs more support and awareness to improve their situation.</p>

  <p>
We have successfully organized a fundraising concert that featured local artists and performers, such as Sunkissed Lola, Lola Amour, Rob Deniel, and Zack Tabuldo. They entertained the audience and shared the stories of Sitio Bebe.We've also set up donation booths around the area, where people could contribute to our cause. We also had a food and beverages section, sponsored by McDonaldâ€™s, Redbull, CocaCola, Gardenia, and Nestle who offered their products to the attendees. We also conducted some unexpected activities after the concert, such as silent auctions, that raised more funds for Sitio Bebe. These activities were not advertised in our posters or posts, so they were a pleasant surprise for the participants.</p>
